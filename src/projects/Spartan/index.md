The Spartan Quality Management System (QMS) was a traditional client-server enterprise application
used to streamline automated testing and data management for midsize
RF and microwave component factories.

With Spartan QMS, companies could get automated testing and data analytics running
quickly and inexpensively. The target market for Spartan QMS was midsize manufacturing
operations producing ten to hundreds of assemblies per day that required significant
RF testing operations as part of the manufacturing process.

Spartan QMS was installed onto one of the company's servers or was supplied on a new server.
Test stations throughout the production line were connected to the company IT infrastructure
via TCP/IP (Ethernet/LAN) and set up within the Spartan QMS configuration database to
carry out the automated testing. Spartan QMS automatically distributed the appropriate
test runners to the test stations and collected and indexed the resulting test data.

The key technologies leveraged with the Spartan QMS system were the enterprise server
program model and database. Additionally, the local test equipment interface drivers
distributed from the central server proved effective in reducing the complexity of testing
allowing new or minimally skilled operators to perform the testing. Finally, the automatic
data repository index created by a crawler program made the production line test data
immediately available for reporting and production quality metrics.
